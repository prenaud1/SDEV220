Most of this code is not actually part of the assignment, as it was just me creating the db.
So it is commented out.
The first part (with the zoo) is from the textbook. The second part (books) is from the question,
but the final part (with sqlalchemy) will likely fail unless the books db is created first, and
you pip install sqlalchemy.
